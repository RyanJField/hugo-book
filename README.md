# Modified Hugo Book Theme

This theme is based on the Hugo [Book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme, with the search bar from the Jekyll [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) theme, and some extra tweaks. Forked from [RyanJField/hugo-book](https://github.com/RyanJField/hugo-book). This repo provides the theme for the SCRC website, which contains information related to datasets, the data pipeline, and various other technical documents associated with the SCRC project.
